# Face-Evaluator
Welcome to FaceEvaluator, a face detection machine learning project that employs Deep Neural Networks to assess facial attractiveness. This project is designed to determine whether a face is perceived as good-looking or not by training the model with a curated set of training images.

The face evaluation machine learning model analyzes facial appearance based on a set of images classified as “good looking” or “not good looking”. The first step is to collect the images from google and organize them into directory structure. In the provided code, TensorFlow is used and Keras is used for preprocessing the data, filtering out irrelevant images and preparing the data for training. To train the neural network model, the image dataset will be loaded using the following methods: Using the TF.KERAS.UTD file, the dataset will be loaded from TF.KERAS.Image_Dataset_From_Directory with extra checks to make sure the images are valid. Once the dataset is loaded, it will be normalized to the [0] to [1] range. The dataset will then be divided into Training, Validation, and Test sets. A Sequential model is used to build the neural network model. The model consists of the following layers: Adam optimizer Max-pooling layer Flattening layer Fully connected layers The model is compiled using binary cross entropy loss function
The model is trained using the fit method with training and validation datasets, the training history is saved, and the model’s performance is presented in the form of accuracy graphs. The prediction function is used to make predictions based on new data. It is important to note that the performance of the model depends heavily on the representativeness and quality of the training data set. Users are encouraged to fine tune hyperparameters, try different architectures, and possibly include transfer learning to improve the model. The code is annotated with comments to make it easier to understand and modify. Explore the potential of the face evaluation machine learning model and contribute to the continuous quest for understanding aesthetic perception through artificial intelligence.
